# Features
## User Authentication
- Smiles uses Devise to implement user authentication. Users can sign up for an account, log in, and log out. Passwords are securely encrypted and stored in the database.

## Posts
- Users can create posts on Smiles, which can include text, images, and links. Posts can be edited and deleted by their creators. Users can also view a feed of posts from other users.

## Comments
- Users can comment on posts on Smiles. Comments can be edited and deleted by their creators.

## Smiles
- As a project, instead of liking a post, a user smiles at a post
- Users can as well see the number of smiles on other users posts
- Users can only smile at a post once, and can unsmile at a  post if they change their mind.

## API
- The Smiles API provides endpoints for all of the features listed above. Authentication is required for all endpoints except for the signup and login endpoints.

## Authentication
User authentication is implemented using Bcrypt, and access tokens are generated using the jwt gem. To authenticate a user, send a POST request to the /users/sign_in endpoint with the user's email and password in the request body. The API will respond with an access token, which should be included in the headers of all subsequent requests that require authentication.

## Endpoints
* POST /users - Create a new user
* POST /users/sign_in - Authenticate a user and retrieve an access token
* GET /posts - Retrieve a list of all posts
* POST /posts - Create a new post
* GET /posts/:id - Retrieve a single post by ID
* PUT /posts/:id - Update a post by ID
* DELETE /posts/:id - Delete a post by ID
* POST /posts/:id/comments - Create a new comment on a post
* PUT /comments/:id - Update a comment by ID
* DELETE /comments/:id - Delete a comment by ID
* POST /posts/:id/smiles - Create a new smile on a post
* DELETE /smiles/:id - Delete a smile by ID
